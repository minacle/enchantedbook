# Enchanted Book

## Description

Introducing the "Enchanted Book" plugin for Minecraft! This plugin allows players to extract the enchantments from their enchanted armour and tools and place them into an "Enchanted Book". By using the anvil, players can sacrifice their enchanted items to obtain the respective "Enchanted Book".

## Features

- **Enchantment Extraction**: Use an anvil to combine a book and an enchanted item to extract its enchantments into an "Enchanted Book".
- **Vanilla Experience**: Costs associated with the extraction process follow the same calculations as vanilla Minecraft, ensuring the experience feels genuine.

## Installation

1. Ensure you are running PaperMC 1.20 or a compatible version.
2. Download the latest version of the "Enchanted Book" plugin.
3. Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` directory.
4. Restart your server.

## Usage

1. Open an anvil's GUI.
2. Place a book in the first slot.
3. Place your enchanted item in the second slot.
4. Once combined, the enchanted item will be consumed, and you'll receive an "Enchanted Book" with the enchantments.
